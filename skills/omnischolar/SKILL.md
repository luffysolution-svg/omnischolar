# OmniScholar

Choose the smallest workflow that answers the request. Follow the user's language; keep tool names and configuration identifiers in their exact English form.

## Route the request

- Literature, patents, authors, citation graphs, recommendations, journals, snippets, or datasets: follow `scholar-search`.
- Local collections, metadata, notes, annotations, attachments, or PDF selection: follow `zotero-research`.
- Structured PDF text, equations, tables, figures, or close reading: follow `paper-reading`.
- Citation evidence, candidates, formatting, or insertion: follow `academic-citation`.
- Generated or edited illustrations: follow `scientific-figure`.
- Materials Project records and exports: follow `materials-project`.
- CAS substance records and contract status: follow `chemical-data`.

For an unfamiliar environment, call `omnischolar_status`, `omnischolar_capabilities`, and the relevant source-status tool before selecting a provider. For image work, call `omnischolar_image_models` with discovery enabled first: show usable models and their declared capabilities, ask the user to choose when multiple valid models materially differ, and otherwise select the newest usable model appropriate to the requested task. If no provider supports the requested capability, report the missing configuration or capability and offer an available non-equivalent workflow only with a clear label.

The generated configuration enables provider sections by default. Use providers with configured credentials and report `credential_required` when a selected provider is not configured.

## Safe multi-stage sequence

1. Search only when discovery is needed; preserve provider provenance and identifiers.
2. Match a local Zotero record by DOI, then normalized title/year/author. Never guess between ambiguous candidates.
3. Read the aggregate Zotero item and identify the intended attachment.
4. Call `omnischolar_sync` with `action=plan` before parsing or changing output.
5. Call `omnischolar_parse` only when structured PDF extraction is necessary and both configuration and the current tool call authorize external upload.
6. Read generated content progressively and verify claims against retrieved evidence.
7. Format citations only after identity and relevance checks.
8. Route image work by declared capability, then inspect the result for scientific errors.

For Semantic Scholar, keep paper and author operations separate: use `literature_search`/`literature_get` for papers, `literature_graph` for recommendations and citation relations, and `literature_author` for author search, author detail, or an author's papers. Respect provider throttling and `Retry-After`; do not treat a transient 429 or 5xx as evidence that the API is unsupported.

For image calls, read each selected model's `supported_parameters` from `omnischolar_image_models` before calling `omnischolar_image_generate` or `omnischolar_image_edit`. Provider parameter support is not interchangeable: OpenAI GPT Image uses `size`, Google Gemini uses `aspectRatio`/`resolution`/`outputFormat`, Vertex Gemini uses `aspectRatio`/`resolution`/`outputFormat`/`n`, Fal varies by model, and native DashScope/Qwen uses `size`/`n`/`negativePrompt`/`seed` without background or quality controls. Qwen AI Platform uses the public DashScope endpoint and does not require a workspace; Bailian workspace endpoints are a separate regional configuration.

For custom providers, model discovery first uses `options.modelCatalogEndpoint` when configured and otherwise tries the OpenAI-compatible `baseUrl/models` endpoint. Treat catalog entries without explicit capability metadata as `model_capabilities_unpinned`; use the configured `models` contract to authorize image operations when the downstream provider has no usable catalog.

Fal generation defaults to `options.sync_mode=true` to avoid downloading result CDN URLs; set it to `false` only for an endpoint that requires hosted output URLs.

## Boundaries

- Zotero is GET-only and local-only. Never expose port 23119 or request a write operation.
- Ai4Scholar is an explicitly selected paid source, not a silent literature fallback.
- MinerU uploads the selected PDF. A sync recovery action must not trigger a remote upload; repair or reparse may upload only when cache is insufficient and the user explicitly authorizes it.
- Preserve local modifications. On `conflict`, use the `.conflicts/` candidate and ask the user how to reconcile it.
- Never expose credentials, Authorization headers, signed URLs, or local private paths in answers.
- Do not blindly retry authentication failures, rate limits, ambiguous paid submissions, unsafe archives, or terminal jobs.
- AI-generated scientific images are illustrative drafts, never experimental results or measured data.

## Output

Write only beneath the configured output root. The default managed layout is:

```text
<output-root>/Literatures/<paper>/
├── <paper>.md
├── metadata.json
└── assets/
```

Preserve provenance in `metadata.json`, respect the user's citation style and language, and keep missing or uncertain values explicit.
